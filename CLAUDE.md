# Provider Matrix for Crossplane

This provider enables management of Matrix (https://matrix.org) resources through Crossplane.

## Current Status (2025-01-16)

### Completed
- ✅ All CRD types defined (User, Room, Space, PowerLevel, RoomAlias)
- ✅ Matrix API client implementation using mautrix-go v0.18.0
- ✅ All controllers implemented with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Provider configuration and credential management
- ✅ Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, API docs)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline setup
- ✅ Example manifests for all resources
- ✅ Code generation (DeepCopy methods)
- ✅ Basic test infrastructure
- ✅ Makefile test targets fixed - `make test` now runs all tests

### Known Issues
1. **Test Coverage: ~15-20%** (Critical)
   - Controller reconciliation logic: 0% coverage
   - Matrix API operations: 0% coverage  
   - Admin API functions: 0% coverage
   - Only utility functions have good coverage

2. **Test Compilation**
   - Most tests now compile and run
   - Controller tests have crossplane-runtime API incompatibilities
   - 1 minor test failure in URL validation

3. **Pending Tasks**
   - Fix remaining controller test compilation errors
   - Improve test coverage to 70-80%
   - Add mock infrastructure for testing
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for all controllers
   - Add integration tests with test Matrix server

### Technical Debt
- Controller tests need updating to match current crossplane-runtime API
- Need mock clients to test without real Matrix server
- Missing error scenario testing
- No performance/load testing

## Resources

The provider manages the following Matrix resources:

- **User** - Matrix user accounts with profiles
- **Room** - Matrix rooms with various configurations
- **Space** - Matrix spaces (special rooms for organizing other rooms)
- **PowerLevel** - Room power level configurations
- **RoomAlias** - Human-readable room aliases

## Development Notes

1. Uses mautrix-go v0.18.0 (MPL-2.0 licensed)
2. Supports both Client-Server API and Synapse Admin API
3. Requires Matrix server with admin API enabled for full functionality
4. Test with `make test` (currently ~15-20% coverage)
5. Build with `make build`
6. Generate code with `make generate`
